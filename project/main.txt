#Sources
Sources for example are lecture slides, lecture videos, references to studies,
textbooks, articles and other 3rd party sources. These are typically primary
sources. These are the "macro" collections of information to be studied.

For example in a film class this might contain a list of films and commentary
texts. These get broken down into "micro" #Cards. The idea is for the student to
oscillate between the #Sources and #Cards in order to acquire information in both
the "macro" and "micro" contexts. These will complement each other by providing
repetition in the "micro" which helps understand the "macro" context in a more
complete manner. In a complementary sense, the "macro" helps set memorization
in context to avoid wrote memorization

#Cards
Just like the flash cards you are familiar worth, but these are n-sided cards
and can hold text, audio, video, or animations. These can be tracked as
right/wrong on the student level. 1 card side should be tied to a reference
text (page, chapter, problem, etc.).

#Contexts
Questions or prompts that encourage students to apply the information memorized
from cards. Gives teacher a chance to provide manual and/or automated feedback.
"Missed" information can make recomendations for cards and sources to review.
